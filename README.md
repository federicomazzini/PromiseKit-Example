# PromiseKit Example Using Swift for iOS

### This Example is a Work in Progress

For now, it contains examples on:
* Using a wrapper from the pod PromiseKit/Alamofire.
* Retrying an async call using PromiseKit.
* Wrapping async tasks and using them in a promise chain.

This project uses a live json response, I used [mocky](https://www.mocky.io). The json for regenerating that response is in the file `characters.json`.
